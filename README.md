# WheatMod
A Forge mod for Minecraft that fundamentally changes how Wheat works.

This readme is broken up into three sections. The first section is mostly spoiler-free, for those who want to install and discover the new features for themselves. The second section contains spoilers for most of the mod features so you can get stuck in and play the mod. The third section contains secrets that are intended for players to discover for themselves. Only read this section if you really want to know all the details of the mod.

## Spoiler Free
This mod changes how wheat works in Minecraft. It will be slightly harder to find wheat, and even when you do it will be inedible wild wheat. You must figure out how to cultivate the wheat and ultimately how to grind flour and create the new food items. 

## Spoilers
WARNING: Spoilers for those who want to try and discover things for themselves!

### Wild Wheat
Only wild wheat is naturally generated. There are two kinds of wild wheat: einkorn, found in grass or woodland, and emmer, found near rivers and in marshes. The hay from wild wheat can be used to lure, tame, and feed animals just like wheat in the vanilla game. Wild wheat cannot be used to produce food for human consumption, however.

### Cultivating Wheat
To cultivate wild wheat it must be planted on farmland. There is a chance that the wild wheat will turn into a form of cultivated wheat. Common Wheat and Emmer Wheat can be used to produce flour. Durum wheat can produce durum flour. Finally, Einkorn grain can be mixed with milk to produce porridge.

### Diseased Wheat
All kinds of wheat have a chance of becoming diseased. There are ways to prevent this that the player should discover for themselves. Rumor has it there is a kind of wheat that can be bred that is especially disease resistant.

### Making Flour and dough
To make flour you need to grind grain into flour. To do so you need a mortar and pestle. A mortar and pestle can be made out of a stone bowl and a small stone. Stone bowls are made in the same way as normal bowls, only using stone (not cobblestone!) instead of wood. Small stones are made by taking natural stone (i.e. cobblestone) and placing it in the crafting grid. Combine the two and you have a mortar and pestle.

Combining the mortar and pestle with Common Grain or Emmer Grain will make Flour. Combining it with Durum Grain will make Durum Flour.

TODO: Flour Mill.

### Making Bread and other Food
Most food in this mod needs cooking in a smoker. Some food can also be cooked on a campfire.

Flour can be made into dough by mixing it with water. Durum flour will make raw pasta. A water bucket can make 8 dough, while a water bottle has enough water to make a single piece of dough.

Combining three dough will make bread dough. Cookie Mix and Cake Mix can be made using the vanilla recipes, only replace wheat with dough.  There are other foods to discover in this mod - try mixing with water, meat, fish, or apples to discover some new food.

### Creating Bales and Straw Mats
All types of wheat can be converted into hay bales (wild) or straw bales (cultivated). They can also be converted back similar to the vanilla recipes. Currently signal fires will only work when you use Emmer Hay Bales (TODO: Fix this!).

Cultivated wheat can also be converted into Straw Mats (three in a row). These are purely decorative and act like carpets, except they have a straw bale texture.
